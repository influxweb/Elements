> Elements is the base developer framework and methodology used for creating our ReadyThemes.

This framework is designed to be used as a foundation for building custom websites or your own ReadyThemes. While the core of the framework is a tested, CSS base, we also include quality tested JavaScript functionality and extensions like tabs, accordions, and carousels.

## Features

#### Extensible

Includes the necessary building blocks to create many of the common UX design patterns. Unique components can easily be created by extending the framework.

#### BEM-IT-ECSS

Developed with the [BEMIT methodology](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) in mind. [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) promotes component modularity, [IT](https://itcss.io/) helps control the architecture, and [ECSS](https://ecss.io/) helps to make extending the framework more manageable.

#### Modern Grid

Elements is an evergreen-browser framework with a modern Flexbox grid system. No more having to remember to clear your floats or use conditional classes.
